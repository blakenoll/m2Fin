After 20+ years of experience in investment management, the genesis of M2 began in 2015 out of a series of events that introduced the opportunity to put together a unique offering of wealth & investment management, equity research and retirement plan consulting.  

The initiation of this effort and focus started with Mark MacArthur seeing the opportunity to harness a combination of experience, ideas, product and investment solutions into a business model that prioritized an intentional focus.  Around that time Mark MacArthur and David Ryan meeting to discuss investing and stewardship.  Out of the clear common bond of Biblical mindset, there was the quick formation of EASI Investments LLC, which coincided with the soon after creation of M2 Capital Advisors.  Over a period of time, Mark MacArthur began a deliberate effort of focusing the work of bringing careful, skillful care to the finances entrusted him; then applying many key components into investment management and retirement plan consulting with an emphasis on managing risk through portfolio construction, strategic allocation and broader asset diversification. 

In 2017, the M2 Stewardship Group was launched to bring together multiple disciplines and endeavors of investing, all with a commitment to a very clear stewardship driven business.  The Bible (Luke 6:31) accounts the words of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount: “Treat others the same way you want them to treat you.”  This simple axiom is the fundamental driver of our service.  While it doesn’t address how or what to invest in, it does speak to the mindset of responsibility and discernment as priority.  

In fact, in the investment business the concept of Fiduciary is the function Advisors at M2 typically function in . It is defined: A fiduciary is a person who holds a legal or ethical relationship of trust with one or more other parties. Typically, a fiduciary prudently takes care of money or other assets for another person.   

In the process of developing M2, Mark MacArthur acquired the Accredited Investment Fiduciary (AIF) designation to formalize this priority.
